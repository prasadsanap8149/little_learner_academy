## 🏢 **Integrated Admin Panel System** (High Priority Addition)

### � **Dashboard Overview**
A comprehensive admin interface **built directly into the Flutter app** with role-based access control. Specific email addresses will have admin privileges, while others access the normal user interface.

**🎯 Key Innovation**: Unlike traditional web-based admin dashboards, this admin panel is part of the same Flutter app, providing seamless integration, real-time updates, and cross-platform compatibility.

#### 🎯 **Core Admin Features**
- **User Management**: View, manage, and support all registered users
- **Game CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete games dynamically
- **Content Management**: Update game assets, questions, and educational content
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into user engagement and learning progress
- **Subscription Management**: Handle billing, refunds, and plan changes
- **Support System**: Handle user queries and technical issues

#### 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

##### **Integrated Flutter Architecture**
```dart
// Admin Access Control
class AdminService {
  static const List<String> adminEmails = [
    'admin@littlelearnersacademy.com',
    'sanapprasad2021@gmail.com',
    'content@littlelearnersacademy.com',
    // Add more admin emails as needed
  ];
  
  static bool isAdminUser(String email) {
    return adminEmails.contains(email.toLowerCase());
  }
  
  static AdminRole getAdminRole(String email) {
    switch (email.toLowerCase()) {
      case 'admin@littlelearnersacademy.com':
        return AdminRole.superAdmin;
      case 'content@littlelearnersacademy.com':
        return AdminRole.contentManager;
      default:
        return AdminRole.support;
    }
  }
}

enum AdminRole {
  superAdmin,    // Full access to everything
  contentManager, // Game and content management
  support        // User support and basic analytics
}
```

##### **App Structure Integration**
